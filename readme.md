# Support Ticketing Theory Question (4 June 2021)

This is my submission for a theory question about support ticketing that I was asked when shortlisted for an IT support role. The given scenario is that I am already working on an existing task when an urgent ticket has just been logged into the system. I had to answer with what I would do next, along with any experience in dealing with similar situations in a professional context.

My submission was made on 4 June 2021. It was later converted to markdown and shared publicly on 30 October 2021.
