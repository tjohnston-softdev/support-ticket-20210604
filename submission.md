### Answer

Back when I was working at Response Services Incorporated, I often worked on multiple tasks concurrently and had to prioritise them as needed. Generally speaking, the more urgent something sounded, the higher priority it took over other tasks. For some of these tasks, my boss was happy for me to handle it at my own pace whereas for other tasks, I had to drop everything and devote all of my energy until it was considered to be resolved.

Looking at this particular scenario, the more recent support ticket appears to be a service issue that impacts multiple users. It is easy to see how this would be considered urgent but since it does not impact *everybody*, it might not be a critical matter. All the same, an issue that impacts multiple users would definitely take priority over something that affects only one specific customer. Therefore, we can satisfy multiple customers across the one issue, as well as mitigate any future complaints regarding similar issues. When I was working at RSI and had to fix a website issue (that often affects multiple users), I would approach the issue in isolation and hope that it reduces the amount of future support tickets in the long-term.

Since I consider the website support ticket to be a higher priority, I will put my current task to the side and work on resolving the issue at hand. If I cannot add any more tasks to my workload, I will attempt to delegate existing, lower-priority tasks where possible to my colleagues. This could also work in vice-versa where somebody else could handle the website while I catch up on other tasks. Of course, this is just a general overview of what I might do and not every practical scenario would be the same.

For a more qualified answer, I found an [article](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/halp/top-5-ways-to-prioritize-and-resolve-it-support-tickets-faster) on Atlassian which describes five different methods which might help prioritise and resolve IT support tickets more efficiently. The first suggestion is to identify recurring issues so that time is not wasted on problems that have already been solved. By extension, you might also want to merge redundant support tickets into a single overall issue. The second suggestion is to understand the issue and how it affects both the users and the company. In other words, the ticketing system needs to allow the user to enter specific details about their issue such as error log details.

The third suggestion is to communicate business processes in a timely manner. If you are working to resolve the issue, try to update the user along the way regarding any progress. The fourth suggestion is to assign tickets a priority as well as a resolution time. Assessing these variables help structure the team and assign tasks accordingly.

Finally, the fifth suggestion is to design a workflow that delegates tasks efficiently. Distributing tasks across the whole team and not just one person will reduce delays, confusion and frustration.
